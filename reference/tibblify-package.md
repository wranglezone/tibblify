# tibblify: Rectangle Nested Lists

A tool to rectangle a nested list, that is to convert it into a tibble.
This is done automatically or according to a given specification. A
common use case is for nested lists coming from parsing JSON files or
the JSON response of REST APIs. It is supported by the 'vctrs' package
and therefore offers a wide support of vector types.
